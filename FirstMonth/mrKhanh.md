### Wrong speaking and Wrong grammar:

> Will we play among us with english?
> than english would be funny and more practical for us
> Vinh and Kiet can be join as the team

### Solution:

> It would be funnier (more fun) if Vinh and Kiet could join this game with us, and I think it is a pratical proposal (một đề nghị thiết thực)

#### it's unlikely you'd ever use "funner" unless you wanted to sound silly. I checked a few forums, and the general consensus is that funner/funnest sound a little babyish. So use this pattern:

- fun - more fun - the most fun.

To clear up some confusion by other members...

- funny - funnier - the funniest

"Fun" and "funny" have clearly different usages, despite both being related to entertainment.

### Warning basis grammar:

> i'm gammer
> i'm a best Gamer
> couture = Cao tu re

- I'm a gamer not gammer
- I'm the best gamer (the most, the best)

- couture = Cao tu re , I am warning you, this mistake is unacceptable, if you repeat this mistake, I will fine you 10,000 VND per character
