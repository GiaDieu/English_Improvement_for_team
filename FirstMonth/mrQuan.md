### I think it is not good approach to speak or write like this:

> Actually, that's good idea
> beside you bring the game cultural to this team
> is that good?

### Solution:

> Actually, that is a good idea. Bringing the game of English Improvement Project with the other members is a good advice. I couldn't agree more!
